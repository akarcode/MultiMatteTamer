This MaxScript makes it very easy to apply Object ID's and store the MultiMatte Render Elements.

Objects are selected within the grid table. If objects and layers in your scene are not recognized by its name this script will not be much use.

#### Requirements

To create the render elements this script needs V-Ray since MultiMatteElement is part of V-Ray.

#### Changelog

v1.0 (Initial release)
